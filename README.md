# Topic Map Clustering 
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe briefly what your software is. What problem does it solve? At what target audience is it aimed? -->
This is a proof of concept finding semantic clusters in data done for the Peltarion AI acellerator cohort #3. The goal is to detect semnantic clusters in data. We use a dataset from trip advisor review provided by kaggle (see https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews). We then ran this against a [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/documentation/modeling-view/build-an-ai-model/blocks/universal-sentence-encoder) model, that was created on [Peltarion](https://peltarion.com) and stored the response (due to optimization and seccurity issues) on AWS S3. You can see the response here: https://dasheck0-public.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/text_embeddings.json.

It contains the 512-component embedding of the provided texts. This is than shaped into an array of two dimensional vectores using umap and plotted (see screenshot below). We than use a dbscan implementation by turf to detect clusters based on a given distance threshold. Each cluster is written to  `./clusters` with a description. Cluster description is derived by calculating the top terms of each document in the cluster using a `tf-idf` implementation.

Here are some learnings:
- Clustering works. However, it depends vastly on the threshold. Eventually we have to come up with something interactively to determine a proper threshold
- TFIDF is a good starting point but often produces no proper descriptions. However, it gives a good indication whether the threshold is too small (and therefore produces to tiny clusters). Of clusters share the same description calculated by TFIDF we probably can combine the clusters
- We should try the [Sentence XLM-R](https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/documentation/modeling-view/build-an-ai-model/blocks/xlm-r-encoder) instead of [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://peltarion.com/knowledge-center/documentation/modeling-view/build-an-ai-model/blocks/universal-sentence-encoder), to create embeddings and compare results
- We shape the 512-component embedding of the texts to 2-dimensional vectors, so that we can plot them on a 2D plane. This might result in information loss. We should use higher dimensional vectors and apply dbscan to that to see if we get better quality results.

<!-- section: Development -->
<!-- If you software is developed within a team you shhould include this section. Describe how to setup thhe project. Include dependencies, conventions and other things to know in order to start developing. In short: After reading this section everyone should be able to develop this piece of software. -->

### How to setup and run this project
Run the following steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/dasheck0/topic-map-clustering
cd topic-map-clustering
npm i 
node index.js
```

No need to create a `.env` file at the moment, since data is loaded from publically available S3 bucket.
